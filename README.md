# USERS API READ ME

### How to use

- Inside server folder run the folloing command line: *npm start*
- The server will run on http://localhost/5000 and you can use /users route to access users api

Obs: I'm using a personal cluster at mongodb atlas cloud, so the data persists even after the server is closed.
